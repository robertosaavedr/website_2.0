For my Bachelor's thesis I trained a model in a [dataset of videos](https://sites.google.com/site/achrafbenhamadou/-datasets/miracl-vc1) to predict which word
was a person uttering in the video, I used three approaches, PCA + Support Vector Machine, PCA + Hidden Markov Model and neural networks.
You can check the [github repo](https://github.com/robertosaavedr/lip-reading) of the project.
