In November 2021, I participated in a hackathon organized by [Cassini](https://hackathons.cassini.eu/), 
the goal of the hackathon was to develop solutions that solve problems in 
the Arctic, such as safe passage at sea, wildlife or life on land. I was part of team of 6 people who decided to work in the safe passage at sea challenge. 
We proposed to solve an optimization problem, where the objetive was to minimize
the time spent by vessels in the sea, but with the constraint of not navigating 
in routes where vessels could harm animals.
