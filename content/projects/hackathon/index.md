In november of 2020, I participated in a hackathon organized by [compluemprende](https://www.ucm.es/compluemprende),
I was part of a team of 5 people, the goal was to develop a startup in a weekend, our idea was to gather
data from peoples cars with the intention of measuring their driving skills, with this data we could help them in two ways, first,
we offer driving tips, second, we offer them a custom car insurance based on their driving performance. After the hackathon, we decided to continue with the project,
unfortunely, all of us were working in other projects, such as studying or having a job, and we left the project, this made me realized that creating a startup is a big commitment.
