title: About Me
---

I am Roberto Saaavedra, I was born in Peru, but I moved to Madrid, Spain when I was
a child, because of my father's work. Having grew up in two different countries has given me
an unique culture and make me more aware of the differences between different places. I studied 
Applied Statistics and have finished in June 2022, I would like to gain experience working in the real
world and figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life, although I know it is somewhere between
data, statistics, machine learning and computer science. In my free time I like to read, lift weights, hike, travel and spend time with the people I care.
