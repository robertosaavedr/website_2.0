When I was 8 years old I came to Madrid with my parents, I left Peru and after a 20-hour flight I arrived to Madrid where my father was already living for several years, my grandparents, uncles, cousins and friends still were living in Peru (and still are). Everything I knew up to that moment changed, I found myself
in a big new city, a new neighborhood, where people spoke with a different accent, and in a new school with different classmates, probably an incredibly big change for a 8 years old
child. Now, 15 years later I can see the great things of having moved to another country.

Peru and Spain have many things in common, such as the language, religion and probably more things that I can't think of right now, but also 
have some differences, food, the humor, transport, streets, the way people live (at least how people around me lived in Peru vs how people around me live in Madrid), 
among others. I think this experience has allowed me to see that different cultures and places are beautiful, and try to value the experiences that other people have had and try to learn from them. Also it has give me the willingness to discover how people live in other parts of the world. Also, It is great to come back to Peru and visit my family.

Another thing that I have learned is to value my personality and myself, since I arrived to Madrid I felt different than the other childs, i.e my classmates, maybe it could have been for the skin color, maybe socioeconomic status or maybe I was just overwhelmed by changes, but this feeling remained for many years. I considered myself different in a bad way, "less" valuable than my peers, which is added to the fact that historically I have been a shy person (although in the last 6 years I have made huge improvementes on my shyness). Thankfully, in the last years I have started valueing being different than other people, which is not only related to where I was born, but to other interest that I have.

I think the experiences in your life shape the way you are, I felt moving to another country is difficult, in this paragraph I would like
to emphasize th economic aspect of it, my mother and me arrived to Spain in the mid of the financial crisis of 2008, I am grateful that we have enough
money for food and housing, but we live with a tigh economy, in the future this has taugth me to do not take for granted the things that I have to day. For
instance for many years we didn't go to restaurants, have vacations or internet at home, right I have those things and I can value them more. Up to I was 18 years old, my
parents rented the rooms that we have free, so for 10 years I live with many people from many countries, sometimes I didn't like it but today I see it as a interesting 
experience, and has make me value intimacy.

Finally, I would like to say that I am very glad of having spent the last 15 years of my life in Spain, 
I have had an exposure to many things, I have had the opportunity to live for several months in Ireland and the United States,
maybe, I couldn't have had that opportunity if I had stayed in Peru for all my life.

Unfortunely, not everything are good stuff, for instance, being far from your family make you
get away from them and when you go to visit them back is not the same. Another bad thing is distance and bad events,
if a loved one has a problem is difficult and expensive to take a 12 hours fly (Madrid-Lima distance in hours).
